package JetBrainsAcademy.Classes.Constructor.SecondaryConstructor

//Write the class IceCreamOrder that has one Int property: price. The class must have two secondary constructors.
//
//The first one takes one Int argument: popsicles, which signifies the number of popsicles the customer wants. The price is calculated as 7 currency units per popsicle.
//
//The second constructor takes two Int arguments: scoops and toppings, which signifies the number of ice cream scoops and the number of different toppings that the customer wants in the order. The price is calculated as 5 currency units per scoop plus 2 currency units per topping.
//
//Note, code style checker may prompt you to use a data class. This is a convenient way to create a class with some basic functionality and we will discuss it later. Until then, try to practice using the secondary constructor!
