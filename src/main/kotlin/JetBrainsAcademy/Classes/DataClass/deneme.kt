package JetBrainsAcademy.Classes.DataClass

//Write a program that reads four numbers (height, twice length, width) and uses all of them as fields of a data class which is Box.
//
//Use copy() function in order to create a second box with a different length value (from input). As a result, there must be two boxes. Print them both.
//
//Sample Input 1:
//
//3
//4
//1
//9
//Sample Output 1:
//
//Box(height=3, length=4, width=9)
//Box(height=3, length=1, width=9)


//// do not change this data class
//data class Box(val height: Int, val length: Int, val width: Int)
//
//fun main() {
//    // implement your code here
//
