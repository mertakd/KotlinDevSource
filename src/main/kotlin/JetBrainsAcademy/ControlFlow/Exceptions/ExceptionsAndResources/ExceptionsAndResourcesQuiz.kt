package JetBrainsAcademy.Projects.CoffeeMachine.JetBrainsAcademy.ControlFlow.Exceptions.ExceptionsAndResources

//Which resources can be released when we invoke use()?
//any external resources




//Why do we need to close resources? Choose the correct options:
//Because at the end of the program, all resources must be closed due to the limited amount of OC memory
//
//There may occur an exception if we don't close resources
//
//Without releasing resources, there will be a lack of memory






//What can we invoke the use() function for?
//To manage resources automatically (including resource releasing)




//What's the difference between Closeable and AutoCloseable interfaces?
//Closeable can throw only an IOException and its inheritors






//What function is used for releasing system resources in Kotlin?
//close
